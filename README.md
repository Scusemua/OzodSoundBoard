# The Ozod Soundboard
The Ozod Soundboard is my first mobile application. It was created basically as a way to begin learning how to create Android applications. The application is a soundboard featuring phrases and catchphrases said by my friend Ozod. It's (presumably) poorly made, doesn't look great, and isn't at all interesting unless you happen to know Ozod personally! This repository contains all of the source code for the application.
